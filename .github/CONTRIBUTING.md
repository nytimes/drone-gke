## Development

### Workflow

The git workflow follows [GitFlow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html).

New features should be based on the `main` branch.

### Dependencies

#### Core

```sh
# run tests for required core dependencies
make check
```

#### Go

[Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) is used to manage dependencies.

### Build, Test, Push

#### Building the `drone-gke` executable

```sh
make drone-gke
```

#### Testing the `drone-gke` executable

```sh
make test-coverage
```

#### Building the `drone-gke` docker image

Using a custom repo name:

```sh
docker_repo_name=alice make docker-image
```

Using a custom tag:

```sh
docker_tag=alpha make docker-image
```

#### Pushing `drone-gke` docker images

> :warning: By default, `make docker-push` will attempt to push to [`nytimes/drone-gke`](https://hub.docker.com/r/nytimes/drone-gke)

Push existing image to custom repo using custom tag:

```sh
docker_repo_name=alice docker_tag=alpha make docker-push
```

### Running `drone-gke` locally

> :warning: Valid GCP service account credentials are required. See ["Creating test service account credentials"](#creating-test-service-account-credentials) for more details.

#### Configuring [`TOKEN`](DOCS.md#secrets)

If you created test service account credentials using ["Creating test service account credentials"](#creating-test-service-account-credentials), those credentials will be used by default.

If using service account credentials that you created manually:

```sh
# replace with correct path
export TOKEN="$(cat /path/to/keyfile.json)"
```

#### Configuring cluster related values

If you have an existing `gcloud` configuration for `container/cluster`, `compute/zone`, or `compute/region`, those values will be used by default.

Otherwise manually configure the following using appropriate values:

```sh
export PLUGIN_CLUSTER=dev
export PLUGIN_ZONE=us-east1-b
# -- or --
export PLUGIN_REGION=us-east1
```

By default, `PLUGIN_NAMESPACE` will be set to `drone-gke-test`.

If you'd like to use the namespace currently configured with `kubectl`:

```sh
export PLUGIN_NAMESPACE=$(kubectl config view --minify --output 'jsonpath={..namespace}')
```

Otherwise manually configure a different namespace value:

```sh
export PLUGIN_NAMESPACE=my-test-ns
```

#### Running a `drone-gke` docker image

> :warning: Assumes `TOKEN` and any cluster related parameters have already been set / exported within the current terminal session

Using sample configurations within `local-example`:

```sh
# `dry-run` and `verbose` are both enabled by default
make run

# disable via the respective `PLUGIN_*` environment variables
PLUGIN_DRY_RUN=0 PLUGIN_VERBOSE=0 make run
```

Using custom configurations with default files:

```sh
# Deploy manifest templates in my-custom-configs

# my-custom-configs
# ├── .kube.sec.yml
# ├── .kube.yml
# └── vars.json

export CONFIG_HOME=$(pwd)/my-custom-configs
make run
```

Using custom configurations with _custom_ files:

```sh
# Deploy manifest templates in my-super-custom-configs

# my-super-custom-configs
# ├── app.yml
# ├── custom-vars.json
# └── secrets.yml

export CONFIG_HOME=$(pwd)/my-super-custom-configs
export PLUGIN_SECRET_TEMPLATE=${CONFIG_HOME}/secrets.yml
export PLUGIN_TEMPLATE=${CONFIG_HOME}/app.yml
export PLUGIN_VARS="$(cat ${CONFIG_HOME}/custom-vars.json)"
make run
```

Using custom kubectl version:

```sh
export PLUGIN_KUBECTL_VERSION=1.14
make run
```

If you've built the docker image using a custom repo or tag:

```sh
export docker_repo_name=alice
export docker_tag=alpha
make run
```

To print the commands that would be executed, without _actually_ executing them:

```sh
make run -n
```

### Tips and Tricks

#### `make e2e`

`make e2e` is an alias for:

```sh
make drone-gke
make test-coverage
make docker-image
make test-resources
make run
```

Build and test the `drone-gke` binary, build a `drone-gke` docker image tagged using a custom repo name, and run that docker image against a custom test cluster:

```sh
export docker_repo_name=alice
export PLUGIN_CLUSTER=my-test-cluster
make e2e
```

#### `make release`

> :warning: By default, `make release` will attempt to push to [`nytimes/drone-gke`](https://hub.docker.com/r/nytimes/drone-gke)

`make release` is an alias for:

```sh
make drone-gke
make test-coverage
make docker-image
make docker-push
```

Build, test, and push new image using custom repo, tag values:

```sh
export docker_repo_name=alice
export docker_tag=alpha
make release
```

#### Creating test service account credentials

> :warning: The following requires access to an active GCP project, a GCP user account with sufficient privileges, properly configured `gcloud`, and `terraform` executables. Please review ["Creating and managing service accounts"](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) and the Terraform ["Google Cloud Platform Provider"](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html) documentation before continuing.

##### Setup

Verify `gcloud` configuration:

```sh
# the current / active GCP project will be the owner of your test service account resources
gcloud config list
```

##### Creation and configuration

Run following to verify the test resources that will be created / configured:

```sh
make terraform/test.tfplan
```

Run the following to create / configure the test resources:

```sh
make test-resources
```

##### Clean up

Once you've finished testing, don't forget to delete these test resources:

```sh
make destroy-test-resources
```
